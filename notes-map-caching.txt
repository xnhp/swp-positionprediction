does garbage collection even happen?
only thing calling MapTileCache.garbageCollection is TilesOverlay.finaliseLoop
and AndStu doesn't find usages for that

I could set a breakpoint and test but thats not reliable.

Maybe, in order to 



ways a tile is removed (usages of MapTileCache.remove)
	- MapTileCache.clear
		via MapTileProviderArray.setTileSource:
			can avoid that

		via MapTileProviderBase.detach
			this is called (not exclusively) by MapView.DetachedFromWindow,
			which may be called when the activity
			goes into background [1,2]
			(how does that even make sense? who would implement a caching
			 feature like this?)
			~> confirm this by experiment?

		via MapTileProviderBase.setTileSource

	- MapTileCache.garbageCollection
	- MapTileProviderBase.ZoomOutTileLooper
